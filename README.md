## Hi there! 👋

I am an enthusiastic and inquisitive Analytics Engineer (formerly an Architect in training 🏠) — I have the most fun when figuring out solutions to complex challenges, writing efficient code, and driving decision-making through stories hidden in data.

### dbt Labs
_Analytics Engineer Apprentice_

I became an Analytics Engineer Apprentice at _dbt Labs_ in August 2022 through the _Foundry Program_. After 6 months of intensive studying and working on client projects as part of their _Professional Services_ Team, I was able to develop a wide range of skills and knowledge that prepared me to enter the data world as an Analytics Engineer. Though some of the work was privately developed for clients, here is a list of some of the public work I collaborated on:

- [packages/codegen](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-codegen/pull/85): Contributed to dbt **codegen’s** _generate_model_yaml_ macro by creating jinja statements and for loops that allowed the package to generate yaml files for multiple models at once.
- [packages/dbt_project_evaluator](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-project-evaluator/pull/237): Enhanced compatibility of the _dbt_project_evaluator_ package with Windows OS by creating a macro with over 25 lines of code that detects a computer’s operating system to provide appropriate model directory recommendations. 
- **internal_analytics/model-config-maintenance:** Reviewed Internal Analytics Repository and updated 125 model configurations and their folder structures to standardize model materialization and adhere to dbt best practices.


### Full Data Stack Development for Cat Rescue

### Full Data Stack Development for Fantasy Football League
Designed a full data stack for Fantasy Football league data, consisting of python ingestion scripts, Airflow, BigQuery, dbt core, and Hex.

- [python_script/sleeper_data_tapper](https://github.com/AngelicaLastra/fantasy_football_ingestion_script): This python script accepts a list of Fantasy Football Sleeper App League IDs receives a API response as a JSON file. The script then converts the JSON file into a local CSV file that can be loaded into a Data Warehouse.
