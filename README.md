## Hi there! My name is Angelica Lastra ðŸ‘‹ 

### Quick Intro
I am Enthusiastic and inquisitive Analytics Engineer with a passion for tackling complex challenges, designing efficient and effective data models, and communicating insights. With a background in architecture design and a passion for analytics engineering, I am driven by the stories and trends that are hidden within data, and dedicated to creating user-friendly systems through which they can be shared.

### The Beginning (Before Data)
Before entering the âœ¨ _world of data_ âœ¨ I was an architect in training. My background in architecture and design allowed me to develop strong skills in visualization, user-centered design, and stakeholder management. Though I loved the design world, I quickly realized that I was more interested in understanding the data and trends that would drive our design decisions. Working for a community non-profit where governmental data was key to defining locations of bus stops, libraries, and other amenities, I realized that without data the success of our action plans could crumble. This is where I found data and where my journey begun!

### dbt Labs
I became an apprentice at dbt Labs on August 2022 through their Foundry Program.
